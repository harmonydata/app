For example, if we had to quantify the similarity between “I feel nervous” and “I feel anxious”, most people would agree that these are closer together than either sentence is to “I feel happy”. A semantic text matching algorithm would be able to place a number on the similarity, such as 79%.</description></item><item><title>FAIR Data</title><link>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/fair-data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 14:59:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/fair-data/</guid><description>What are the FAIR Data Principles? The FAIR principles are a set of guidelines for making data more discoverable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The principles are intended to help organizations and individuals maximise the value of their data by making it easier to find, access, and use.
The FAIR principles were published in Nature in 2016 to address the difficulties in reproducing scientific research. Funding organisations, publishers, and governmental agencies are increasingly beginning to require data management plans for data generated in research.</description></item><item><title>Frequently Asked Questions</title><link>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/frequently-asked-questions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 12:33:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/frequently-asked-questions/</guid><description>What is harmonisation? Harmonisation means taking variables from different studies and manipulating them to make them comparable.
For example, if we have datasets of depression from different countries, which is typically measured using a questionnaire, how can we harmonise two depression questionnaires? Typically this is a manual process – we would look at the content and find common elements between the questionnaires.
For an example of a pre-existing harmonisation tool, please see:</description></item><item><title>Measuring the Performance of NLP algorithms</title><link>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/post/2022-12-03-measuring-the-performance-of-nlp-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 01:19:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/post/2022-12-03-measuring-the-performance-of-nlp-algorithms/</guid><description>Harmony was able to reconstruct the matches of the questionnaire harmonisation tool developed by McElroy et al in 2020 with the following AUC scores: childhood 84%, adulthood 80%. Harmony was able to match the questions of the English and Portuguese GAD-7 instruments with AUC 100% and the Portuguese CBCL and SDQ with AUC 89%. Harmony was also evaluated using a variety of transformer models including MentalBERT, a publicly available pretrained language model for the mental healthcare domain.</description></item><item><title>Harmony Questionnaire</title><link>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/post/2022-11-10-harmony-questionnaire/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 19:00:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/post/2022-11-10-harmony-questionnaire/</guid><description/></item><item><title>How does Harmony work?</title><link>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/post/2022-11-03-how-does-harmony-work/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 14:05:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/post/2022-11-03-how-does-harmony-work/</guid><description>When you input two questionnaires into Harmony, such as the GAD-7 and Beck’s Anxiety Inventory, Harmony is able to match similar questions and assign a number to the match. (I have written another blog post on how we measured Harmony’s performance in terms of AUC).
So how does Harmony achieve this?
Harmony uses techniques from the field of natural language processing to identify when two questions deal with a similar topic.</description></item><item><title>How to harmonise questionnaire data with Harmony (video)</title><link>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/post/2022-10-25-harmonise-questionnaire-data-harmony-video/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 15:08:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/post/2022-10-25-harmonise-questionnaire-data-harmony-video/</guid><description/></item><item><title>harmony Privacy Policy</title><link>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 11:33:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/privacy-policy/</guid><description>Our contact details harmonydata.org is provided by Ulster University.

In most social and psychological research different questionnaires are used, such as the GAD-7 and Beck’s Anxiety Inventory, to assess people’s mental health, these questionnaires are also available indifferent languages and have been used in various countries across the world!</description></item><item><title>Harmony</title><link>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/harmony/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 12:11:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmonydata.github.io/website/harmony/</guid><description>harmony Harmonising Mental Health Data Do you need to compare questionnaire data across studies? Do you want to find the best match for a set of items? Are there are different versions of the same questionnaire floating around and you want to make sure how compatible they are? Are the questionnaires written in different languages that you would like to compare?
Harmony is a data harmonisation project that uses Natural Language Processing to help researchers make better use of existing data from different studies by supporting them with the harmonisation of various measures and items used in different studies.</description></item></channel></rss>
